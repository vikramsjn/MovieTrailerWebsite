# Project - Movie Trailer Website
Made as part of my [Machine Learning Foundations Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009-in-basic/).

## Requires
Requires API key for REST calls to [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), to generate the movie trailer page.

## How to use
Run entertainment_center.py and when prompted then enter API public key, and public list id (number) on [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). After processing, an html page will be generated and this will have all the movie trailer's for the movies in the public list on www.themoviedb.org site.
